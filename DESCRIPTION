Description: Implements a multi-species simulation model that tracks population
    growth including reproduction and survival, interactions between prey and
    predators (and between prey and prey) and possibly exploitation. The base model
    is for forage fish in the California Current ecosystem and includes three prey
    species and two predators, but species can be changed or added easily. The model
    is designed to test different parameter sets as "scenarios", and the design is
    modular so that functional relationships can be changed without too much pain.
